\subsection*{Problem 1}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item Section 3.9 Exercise 1.

  \item In Python, set up a simulation to see if the results match what you
  derived in Part (a). Specifically, do $1,000$ draws where you draw
  $X_1, X_2 \overset{iid}{\sim} U(0, 1)$. Then, add them together to get $Y = X_1 + X_2$. Create a histogram on the resulting 1000 $Y$'s. Comment on how it compares
  to the pdf you derived.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Problem 3}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item Section 4.1 Exercise 6.

  \item In Python, draw $1,000$ samples from the pdf given in Part (a).
  Transform the values by taking $1/X$ and calculate the mean. How does it
  compare to the expectation you derived?

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Problem 4}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item Section 4.1 Exercise 4.

  \item Section 4.3 Exercise 2.

  \item In Python, draw $1,000$ words (with replacement) from the sentence given
  in Part (a) and record the number of letters in the word. Compute the variance
  of the result. How does it compare to the variance you derived?
