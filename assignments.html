  <p>Homework assignments are given weekly and should not take longer than 1-2
  hours to complete. Submitted homework assignments will be graded and points
  awarded for questions answered correctly. At the end of each section, all
  points will be tallied and prizes will be awarded to top students.</p>

  <p>While students are not required to complete and submit the homework
  assignments, non-participation will result in extra attention during class
  lectures.</p>

<h2>Collaboration Policy and Honor Code</h2>
You are free to form study groups and discuss homeworks and projects. However, you must write up homeworks and code from scratch independently without referring to any notes from the joint session. You should not copy, refer to, or look at other course's solutions in preparing your answers. It is an honor code violation to intentionally refer to another course’s solutions, either official or written up by another student. More information can be found <a href="assets/files/hw_template.tex">here</a>.
<hr/>
<h2>Submission Instructions</h2>

We will be using the <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/71747">GradeScope</a> online submission system. All students should submit their assignments electronically via GradeScope. Students can typeset or scan their homeworks.<br><br>

To register for GradeScope,

<ul>
    <li>Create an account on GradeScope if you don’t have one already.
    <li>Here are some <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/cs228/submitting_hw_guide.pdf">tips</a> for submitting through Gradescope.
</ul>


<b>Written Assignments:</b> Homeworks should be written up clearly and succinctly; you may lose points if your answers are unclear or unnecessarily complicated. You are encouraged to use LaTeX/Sweave to writeup your homeworks, but this is not a requirement.<br><br>
<b>Late Homework:</b> You have <b>6</b> late days which you can use at any time during the term without penalty. For a particular homework, you can use only 2 late days. Once you run out of late days, you will incur in a 25% penalty for each extra late day you use. Each late homework should be clearly marked as “Late” on the first page. <br><br>
<b>Regrade Policy:</b> You may submit a regrade request if you believe that the course staff made an error in grading. Any regrade requests should be submitted through Gradescope within one week of receiving your grade. Please try to be as specific as possible with your regrade request.<br><br>
